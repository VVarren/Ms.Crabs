# Ms.Crabs
## Nothing to see here.

### Functionality that I have implemented/will make:
1. Give each person on server 3 strikes. Each time they curse and the bot recognizes it, they lose a strike and get a warning. 
   if user.strikes <= 0:
      ban(user)
      
2. If you have any ideas, please put it in the comments.
