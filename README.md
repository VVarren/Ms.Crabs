## Nothing to see here. If you want the bot on your server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=867945463750471731&permissions=8&scope=bot
### This bot tracks the user cross platform. For example, if you lose 1bp in server x, then you have 2bp on all servers.
### Functionality that I have implemented/will make:
1. Give each person on server 3 strikes. Each time they curse and the bot recognizes it, they lose a strike and get a warning. 
   If user.strikes is 0, you get kicked.
2. You can thank people by 'Thank @user' to give them 1 more brownie point     
3. Type '$bp' to check your brownie points.
4. Type '$help' to see all the commands currently implemented
5. If you have any ideas, please put it in the comments.
